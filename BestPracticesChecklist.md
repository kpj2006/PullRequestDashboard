  - *Tool used:* pre-commit hooks (trailing-whitespace, check-yaml, check-json, check-toml, detect-secrets), Danger JS (dangerfile.js), and CodeQL SAST.

- [x] 🔴 **warnings_fixed** — Warnings from the linter are addressed (not suppressed without reason).
  - *Note:* All linter warnings from pre-commit hooks, Danger JS, and CodeQL analysis are addressed before merging.

- [x] 🔵 **warnings_strict** — Project uses maximum strictness in linter config where practical. *(SUGGESTED)*
  - *Note:* Strictly enforces file hygiene, secret scanning, and static analysis via pre-commit and Danger CI checks.

---

## 🔐 Security

### Secure Development Knowledge

- [x] 🔴 **know_secure_design** — At least one primary developer knows how to design secure software (familiar with OWASP, threat modeling, secure-by-default principles).
  - *Self-certification note:* Maintainers follow OWASP principles, local-first data isolation, and least-privilege security design.

- [x] 🔴 **know_common_errors** — At least one primary developer knows common vulnerability types for this software's category and how to mitigate them (e.g., injection, XSS, reentrancy for Solidity, prompt injection for AI).
  - *Self-certification note:* Maintainers are trained in AI prompt injection risks, sensitive API token isolation, and dependency auditing.

### Cryptography (mark N/A if project does not handle cryptography)

- [~] 🔴 **crypto_published** — Only publicly reviewed cryptographic protocols/algorithms are used by default.
  - *Justification:* Application uses standard TLS/HTTPS provided by standard libraries (requests/httpx); no custom cryptographic protocols implemented.

- [~] 🟡 **crypto_call** — Project calls an established crypto library rather than reimplementing crypto functions.
  - *Justification:* Relies on underlying Python standard library and TLS network stack.

- [~] 🔴 **crypto_working** — No broken algorithms (MD4, MD5, single DES, RC4, Dual_EC_DRBG) used unless required for interoperability (must be documented).
  - *Justification:* No broken or deprecated algorithms used.

- [~] 🔴 **crypto_keylength** — Key lengths meet [NIST 2030 minimums](https://www.keylength.com/en/4/) by default.
  - *Justification:* Managed by standard SSL/TLS protocol implementations.

- [~] 🔴 **crypto_password_storage** — Passwords for external users are stored as iterated salted hashes (Argon2id, bcrypt, scrypt, PBKDF2).
  - *Justification:* Pull Request Dashboard does not collect, store, or manage user passwords.

- [~] 🔴 **crypto_random** — Cryptographic keys and nonces are generated using a CSPRNG; insecure generators (Math.random, rand()) are NOT used for security purposes.
  - *Justification:* Application does not generate cryptographic keys or nonces.

- [x] 🟡 **delivery_unsigned** — Cryptographic hashes are NOT retrieved over plain HTTP without a signature check.
  - *Note:* All packages, models, and dependencies are retrieved strictly over HTTPS.

## 🔬 Analysis

### Static Code Analysis

- [x] 🔴 **static_analysis_fixed** — All medium+ severity vulnerabilities found by static analysis are fixed in a timely manner after confirmation.
  - *Note:* CodeQL, Gitleaks, and OSV-Scanner findings are fixed immediately upon detection.

- [x] 🔵 **static_analysis_common_vulnerabilities** — The static analysis tool includes checks for common vulnerabilities in the language/environment (e.g., eslint-plugin-security, bandit, Slither). *(SUGGESTED)*
  - *Tool + ruleset:* CodeQL (python-security-and-quality), Gitleaks secret scanner, and OSV-Scanner.

- [x] 🔵 **static_analysis_often** — Static analysis runs on every commit or at least daily (CI integration). *(SUGGESTED)*
  - *Evidence URL:* https://github.com/AOSSIE-Org/PullRequestDashboard/blob/main/.github/workflows/codeql.yml

### Dynamic Code Analysis

- [~] 🔵 **dynamic_analysis** — At least one dynamic analysis tool is applied before major releases (fuzzer, web app scanner like OWASP ZAP, etc.). *(SUGGESTED)*
  - *Tool used:* `[~]` N/A — *Justification:* Interpreted Python application; no release-time web app scanner or fuzzer integrated.

- [~] 🔵 **dynamic_analysis_enable_assertions** — Dynamic analysis / testing runs with assertions enabled (not just production mode). *(SUGGESTED)*
  - *Note:* `[~]` N/A — *Justification:* No dynamic analysis tool in use.

- [~] 🔴 **dynamic_analysis_fixed** — Medium+ severity vulnerabilities found by dynamic analysis are fixed in a timely manner.
  - *Note:* `[~]` N/A — *Justification:* No dynamic analysis tool in use.

- [~] 🔵 **dynamic_analysis_unsafe** — If the project uses memory-unsafe languages (C/C++), memory safety tools (Valgrind, AddressSanitizer) are used. *(SUGGESTED)*
  - *Note:* `[~]` N/A — *Justification:* Project is developed in Python, a memory-safe language.

## 📎 Project-Specific Notes

> Add domain-specific notes here for Web3, Full-Stack, or AI projects.

### Web3 / Solidity Notes
- Scorecard does not audit Solidity-specific security. Use [Slither](https://github.com/crytic/slither) for `static_analysis` and `warnings` criteria.
- For `crypto_*` criteria, document which cryptographic primitives your contracts rely on (e.g., ECDSA in EVM is standard).
- Smart contract audit reports count as evidence for `know_secure_design`.

### Full-Stack / Next.js Notes
- For `crypto_password_storage`: document which auth library handles hashing (e.g., NextAuth + bcrypt).
- For `dynamic_analysis`: [OWASP ZAP](https://www.zaproxy.org/) can be run as a GitHub Action.

### AI / LLM Notes
- For `know_common_errors`: Maintainers are aware of prompt injection, system context leaking, and validation of local LLM responses (Ollama).
- For `dynamic_analysis`: Local LLM queries and PR summaries are validated dynamically using the dashboard execution pipeline (`main.py`).
